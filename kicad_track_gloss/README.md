# KiCad Track Gloss

KiCad Track Gloss is a KiCad 10 ActionPlugin for shortening and simplifying
existing PCB tracks. Select one or more straight segments and run the action.
The plugin automatically expands the selected connections and treats each
routed chain as a string pulled taut between its electrical terminations. It
repeatedly contracts the complete path against inflated copper obstacles,
reconstructs an exact 0/45/90-degree track, validates the result, and applies
it to the current board as one Undo operation.

Successful operations are silent and never save the board. Use KiCad Undo to
reject a result. A valid no-op plays KiCad's standard warning sound once.

## Actions

- **KiCad Track Gloss** performs the normal one-click operation.
- **KiCad Track Gloss - Diagnostic** performs the same operation and displays
  Result, Details, and JSON tabs with copy actions.

Run either action without a selected straight segment to edit in-memory session
settings. The first setting controls native KiCad DRC for both single-
connection and multi-net selections: disabling it is substantially faster,
but removes that native before/after safety check. The packaged default is
enabled.

Native validation uses private temporary board copies, refills zones, and
compares KiCad DRC reports before and after the candidate. This can add seconds
even when geometric planning is fast. It neither saves nor modifies the live
board.

For larger selections, every expanded connection is planned through the same
workflow as a one-segment selection. The best compatible local composition is
ranked with the global plan. If native DRC rejects the leading candidates, the
plugin retains the best connection batches approved before the session time
budget expires.
